Heavy Haulers Inc. is a fictional company used for this project and I assumed the role of  a Business Analyst for that company. 

The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that will forecast the sales of motor trucks for the next 3 years. By developing an accurate forecast, the company will be better equipped to plan 
its production schedules, manage its inventory, and make informed decisions regarding sales and marketing strategies.

To achieve this objective, historical sales data for heavy trucks during the past 55 years (1964 to 2022) has been taken from FRED.

For feasibility, the units of sales quantity in the original dataset is converted to 1000s from Millions.
